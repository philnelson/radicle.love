Radicle is a game about growing plants
======================================

I want you to build it with me. The game's core code (this repo) will remain 100% open source and freely available for use/modification by anyone, anywhere.

So what's the idea?
-------------------

In Radicle you plant seeds. You water them, you position them in a nice place with lots of (or a little bit of) sun and tend to them like you would any other plant. Time in Radicle passes more quickly than in real life, but not a lot more. It's a game about spending 5 minutes of your day helping something grow.

How are we doing this?
----------------------

The game engine we're using is called [Love2d, and is available for Windows/Mac/Linux for free][love2d]. It's fast, simple, and pretty fully-featured. Since we're using Love2d, Radicle will be written in the Lua scripting language.

What do I get for helping?
--------------------------

A fun game that you helped build and lots of people enjoy.
